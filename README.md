# Responsive-Profile
# Introduction
We were challenged to make a responsive profile to showcase my practical ability by using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is my interpretation of that.

# Elements included
We had to include a landing page, about section, project showcase and contact information. Also ensure that our portfolios are functional on various devices. As well as include easy ways for potential employers or contributors to contact us.

# Reflections
# Areas of Mastery
HTML Layout: An area I believed I was able get completed with minimal need for improvement was the HTML for my landing page. Which encouraged me to focus more time on the CSS and JavaScript

# Challenges Faced
CSS Styling Elements: I feel this area I was lacking in because of how many problems I would encounter and after solving the first issue there would be a new one.

# Areas for Improvement 
I would have liked if I was better able to implement JavaScript because it was challenging ensuring that the code worked.

# Overall Learning Experience
This project helped actualize a version of what my completed personal profile could look like and allowed me to express creative control regarding the UI design.
